# Adarsh Bhandari

I am a passionate **3rd-year B.Tech Computer Science student** with a deep love for Software Engineering. I thrive on building scalable web applications and exploring the intersection of Full-Stack development and Artificial Intelligence.

### What I'm up to:
- I’m currently working on building full-stack applications with Node.js.
- I’m currently deep-diving into **AI/ML** to make my projects smarter.
- I’m looking to collaborate on Open Source projects and innovative web tools.
- Fun fact: I believe there is no problem that a good cup of coffee and a debugger can't solve.
